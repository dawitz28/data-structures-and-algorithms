# 11-kth-from-end
the input (k) has to be less then null(n) for this to give us a postive integer. 

# Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

# Approach & Efficiency
identify the length of the linkedlist.
let n = lenght
then use this approach (n - k + 1)
